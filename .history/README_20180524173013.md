This is a React Native Foreground Service example app inspired by this [issue](https://github.com/Polidea/react-native-ble-plx/issues/217) on the [react-native-ble-plx](https://github.com/Polidea/react-native-ble-plx) bluetooth package.

The intent of this app is to demonstrate how to do background bluetooth scanning using the Android Foreground Service.

## Interval Method

- [ ] Uses [react-native-background-job](https://github.com/vikeri/react-native-background-job)
- [x] Simple setInterval
- [x] option to start Foreground Service

## Action Performed at Each 10 Second Interval

- [x] Writes timestamp to Redux store
- [x] Calls bluetoothScan from [react-native-ble-plx](https://github.com/Polidea/react-native-ble-plx) for devices

```
npm install --save react-native-ble-plx
react-native link react-native-ble-plx
react-native run-android
```
