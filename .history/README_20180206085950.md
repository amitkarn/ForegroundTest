This is a React Native Foreground Service example app inspired by this [issue](https://github.com/Polidea/react-native-ble-plx/issues/217) on the [react-native-ble-plx](https://github.com/Polidea/react-native-ble-plx) bluetooth package.

The intent of this app is to demonstrate how to do background bluetooth scanning using the Android Foreground Service.

```
npm install --save react-native-ble-plx
react-native link react-native-ble-plx
```
